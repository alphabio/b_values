# Session 001: b_values - Kickoff

**Date:** 2025-11-04
**Git Ref:** [Will be captured on next session start]
**Focus:** Initial project planning and setup for b_values

---

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

- Initialized project from b_turbo_template
- Archived template session as 000-template
- Created fresh SESSION_HANDOVER for b_values project

## 📊 Current State

**What's working:**

- ✅ All template infrastructure (build, lint, format)
- ✅ Example app and packages from template
- ✅ Turborepo + PNPM + React 19 + TypeScript stack
- ✅ Complete documentation system with session workflow

**Next to build:**

- Project scope and requirements need to be defined
- Core b_values features and functionality
- App architecture decisions

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Define what "b_values" project is about (purpose, features, goals)
2. Decide if we keep/modify the example `basic` app or create new apps
3. Plan package structure for b_values specific functionality
4. Begin implementation
